# Data-Analysis-with-Python
IBM Data Analysis with Python Course (Week 6) Final Test utilizing JupyterLab

In this project, I am a Data Analyst working at a Real Estate Investment Trust. The Trust would like to start investing in Residential real estate. I am tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. I will analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on.

**Dataset Used in this Assignment **

The dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. It was taken from

It was also slightly modified for the purposes of this course. 
For this project, I utilized JupyterLab running on the Cloud in IBM Skills Network Labs environment. 

It uses python codes to do data-cleaning, analyse data and create models for price prediction, evaluate and refine models. Major activities covered include:

Numerical representation of data using correlation, linear and polynomial regression, R-Squared values, etc
Graphical representation of data using boxplot, and seaborn's regplot.
Model refinement suing ridge regression object.
Polynomial transform of training and test data, etc.
